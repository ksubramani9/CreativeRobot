#Christine Type, Jeremiah Dir and I, Keertana Subramani, worked on this assignment alone, using only this semester's course materials.


The movie about a Scribblr with a mission. A mission to draw a double star and then a spiral onto a whiteboard.
This is a split perspectives piece, with one half being his sight, the other being his partner’s. 
We used splitScreen to split the screen, a modified fade to darken the screen every five frames or so to sim blinking, 
then overlay every so often to display a message.
No deviations were made.
